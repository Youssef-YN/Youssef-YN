# My projects
## Full-Stack Web Application for NTT Data
NTT Data is a leader in the IT world, providing services for more than 75% of the global fortune 100 companies, quite the impressive track record.
I'm very glad I got the opportunity to lead my team of 6 software engineering students at ENSET throughout this project.
It was quite challenging but we're very proud of how well the project turned out

## RogueTD - 2D Tower Defense Game
A work-in-progress 2D tower defense game using the Godot game engine with GDScript as the main programming language. This is my first serious video game project and it serves as a stepping stone allowing me to learn more about the Godot Engine.

## MoreInfo - Hytale server mod
Inspired by the Minecraft 5zig mod that contained plenty of simple but very useful features, MoreInfo is a Hytale server plugin programmed in Java. Developing a mod for Hytale has been challenging due to the lack of proper documentation, meaning the only way to learn was to read the source code of the server.

## Synfo - System Information
This was my first JavaFX project. It's a general system information application.

# Tools & Languages
## Godot
The main game engine I'm using for my video game projects. It's powerful with an amazing node system, especially with its composition-first philosophy. I'm using it for 2 on going projects right now.
## Angular
This was the first front-end framework I ever worked with. It was specified in our "cahier de charges" for the NTT Data project and I learned so much from it that I would not have learned otherwise. A steep learning curve for someone that hasn't used a framework before, but definitely worth it.
## C#
This was the first language I ever made a project with. During my first year of university, I took on an internship allowing me to create said project, it was a desktop application for Excel automation, it took multiple files as input through the UI, then automated the repetitive tasks that they'd usually go through.
## C
First programming language learned, did not create many projects with it but I pursued it anyway so I can learn important concepts such as data structures and algorithms.
## Java
I initially didn't like Java but came to love it because of how powerful it is. It can definitely handle everything from personal works to enterprise level projects. You can see my first Java project for yourself, it's Synfo!
## Python
Immediately after learning the basics of C, I started learning python because of the easy UI and powerful libraries, it's definitely the best for small projects but that definitely does not mean it can't be used for bigger ones.
## Unreal Engine
This is the industry standard engine for 3D work, I have not had any serious projects in Unreal Engine, but I'm slowly learning whenever I find the time for it.
## GIMP
Although not ideal for most of what I do, it has been the tool that I use for asset creation, whether it's banners, tilesets, or profile pictures.
